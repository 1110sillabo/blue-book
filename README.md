This is my personal wiki where I share [everything
I know](everything_i_know.md) about this world in form of an [online
mkdocs book](https://www.mkdocs.org/) hosted on
[GitHub](https://github.com/lyz-code/blue-book).

**The wiki is meant to be read [in the web
format](https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book).**

## Contributing

If you find a mistake anywhere in this wiki, I would appreciate your help. You
can quickly find any entry you wish to edit by [searching for the
topic](https://github.com/lyz-code/blue-book/find/master) and adding your
changes with a PR.

I also appreciate any [ideas you
have](https://github.com/lyz-code/blue-book/issues/new) on how I can
improve this wiki.

## Thank you

If you liked my book and want to make me happy, please see if you know how could
I fulfill any item of my [wishlist](wishlist.md) or see if you want to
contribute to [my other projects](projects.md).
