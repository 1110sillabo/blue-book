This is my personal wiki where I share [everything
I know](everything_i_know.md) about this world in form of an [online
mkdocs book](https://www.mkdocs.org/) hosted on
[GitHub](https://github.com/lyz-code/blue-book).

If this is your first time visiting this wiki, take a look at [meta](meta.md),
as it describes this wiki, its structure and goals in more detail.

# Using the wiki well

You can quickly search the contents of this wiki above or you can explore the
tree view to the left.

Start with the first article that grabs your attention and be ready to
[incrementally read](incremental_reading.md) the rest.

# Make your own wiki

You can view [other similar to this, continuously updated
wikis](https://github.com/RichardLitt/meta-knowledge#readme).

Don't be afraid to create one of your own and share what you know with the
world. If you feel overwhelmed by this daunting task, you may want to read [some
guidelines on how to start](build_your_own_wiki.md).

# Contributing

If you find a mistake anywhere in this wiki, I would appreciate your help. You
can quickly find any entry you wish to edit by [searching for the
topic](https://github.com/lyz-code/blue-book/find/master) and adding your
changes with a PR.

I also appreciate any [ideas you
have](https://github.com/lyz-code/blue-book/issues/new) on how I can
improve this wiki.

# Thank you

If you liked my book and want to make me happy, please see if you know how could
