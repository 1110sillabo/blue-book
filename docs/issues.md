I haven't found a tool to monitor the context it made me track certain software
issues, so I get lost when updates come. Until a tool shows up, I'll use the
good old markdown to keep track.

# Vim workflow improvements

Manually formatting paragraphs is an unproductive pain in the ass,
[Vim-pencil](https://github.com/reedes/vim-pencil) looks promising but there are
still some usability issues that need to be fixed first:

* Wrong list management: [#93](https://github.com/reedes/vim-pencil/issues/93)
    linked to [#31](https://github.com/reedes/vim-pencil/issues/31) and
    [#95](https://github.com/reedes/vim-pencil/issues/95).
* [Disable wrap of document
    headers](https://github.com/reedes/vim-pencil/issues/92) (less important).
