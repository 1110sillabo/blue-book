In this book you'll find, in a wiki format, all the notes I made on a huge
variety of topics, such as, Linux, DevSecOps, feminism, rationalism, [life
automation](life_automation.md), productivity or programming.

The main goal is to store all the knowledge gathered throughout my life in a way
that everyone can benefit from reading it or referencing in an easy and quickly
way.

I will be updating this wiki quite often as I use it myself daily both to keep
an account of things I know as well as things I want to know and everything
in between.

# History

I've tried writing blogs in the past, but it doesn't work for me. I can't stand
the idea of having to save some time to sit and write a full article of
something I've done. I need to document *at the same time* as I develop or
learn. Furthermore, as I usually use incremental reading or work on several
projects, I don't write one article, but improve several at the same time in
a unordered way. That's why I embrace [Gwerns Long Content
principle](https://www.gwern.net/About#long-content).

The only drawback of this format is that I won't have an interesting RSS feed.
You could go through the [git log](https://github.com/lyz-code/blue-book) but it
doesn't make any sense. That's why I'm thinking of generating a monthly newsletter
similar to Gwerns [Newsletters](https://www.gwern.net/tags/newsletter) or
[Changelog](https://www.gwern.net/Changelog).

In 2016 I started writing in text files summaries of different concepts, how to
install or how to use tools. In the beginning it was plaintext, then came
[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), then
[Asciidoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AsciiDoc), I did several refactors to
reorder the different articles based in different structured ways, but I always
did it with myself as the only target audience.

Three years, 7422 articles and almost 50 million lines later, I found [Gwern's
website](https://www.gwern.net/) and [Nikita's
wiki](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz), which made me think that it was time to
do another refactor to give my wiki a semantical structure, go beyond a simple
reference making it readable and open it to the internet.

And the blue book was born.

# Book structure

Each directory is a topic that can include other subtopics under it related to
the parent topic. As sometimes the strict hierarchical structure of the
categories doesn't work, I also use [tags](https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/tags.html)
to link articles.

If this is your first time visiting this wiki, you can just start reading from
the top entry down and see what sparks your interest.

# Content Structure

Each topic will have a title, some description of it, usually my own thoughts
and knowledge on it as well as referencing some resources or links I have liked
or used that helped me either understand the topic or gain appreciation of it.

The structure of each of the posts will often look roughly like this:

1. Title
2. Description - My thoughts on the topic.
3. Subtopics - Various subtopics related to the main topic.
4. Notes - My own personal notes on the matter as well as things I found
   interesting on the internet regarding the topic. I often give a link of where
   I got things from.
5. Links - Links related to the topic.

# Links

My blue book is heavily inspired in this two other second brains:

* [Gwern's website](https://www.gwern.net/)
* [Nikita's wiki](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz)
