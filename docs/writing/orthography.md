Bad grammar can thwart communication. It's especially important in today's world
where we don't have the chance to have in person interactions or when your words
might reach a wide audience. The quality of your text will impact how your
message reaches people.

This article is an effort to gather all my common pitfalls.

# [When to write Apostrophes before an s](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/apostrophe/)

* For most singular nouns, add `apostrophe + s`: *The writer's desk*.
* For most plural nouns, add `apostrophe`: *The writers' desk* (multiple writers).
* For plural nouns that do not end in s, add `apostrophe + s`: *The geese's
    migration route*.
* For singular proper nouns both `apostrophe` and `apostrophe + s` is accepted,
    but as the plural proper nouns ending in s, the correct form is `apostrophe`
    I'd use that for both, so: *Charles Dickens' novels* and *The
    Smiths' vacation*.

The personal pronouns, do *not* have apostrophes to form possessives, such as
your, yours, hers, its, ours, their, whose, and theirs. In
fact, for some of these pronouns, adding an apostrophe forms a contraction
instead of a possessive.

# Who vs Whom

If you can replace the word with *she* or *he*, use *who*. If you can replace it
with *her* or *him*, use *whom*.

* *Who*: Should be used to refer to the subject of a sentence.
* *Whom*: Should be used to refer to the object of a verb or preposition.

# [A vs An](https://www.grammar.com/a-vs-an-when-to-use/)

We were all taught that *a* precedes a word starting with a consonant and that
*an* precedes a word starting with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, and sometimes y). But
what matters is the sound of the letter beginning the word, not just the letter
itself. The way we say the word will determine whether or not we use *a* or
*an*.

If the word begins with a vowel sound, you must use *an*. If it begins with
a consonant sound, you must use *a*.

# [Comma before and](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/comma-before-and/)

There are two cases:

* It's required to put a comma before and when it’s connecting two independent clauses.
* It’s [almost always
    optional](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/what-is-the-oxford-comma-and-why-do-people-care-so-much-about-it/)
    the use of comma before and in lists. This case is also known as *serial
    commas* or *Oxford commas*.

Since in some cases is useful, I'm going to use them to reduce the mental load.

# [Avoid there is at the start of the sentence](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/157830/why-should-sentences-not-start-with-there-is-or-there-are)

Almost never begin a sentence with “It is...” or “There is/are...”. These are
examples of unnecessary verbiage that shift the focus from the sentence point.
