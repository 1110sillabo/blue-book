My english writing is not so good, this articles is an effort to gather all my
common pitfalls.

# Who vs Whom

If you can replace the word with *she* or *he*, use *who*. If you can replace it
with *her* or *him*, use *whom*.

* *Who*: Should be used to refer to the subject of a sentence.
* *Whom*: Should be used to refer to the object of a verb or preposition.

# [A vs An](https://www.grammar.com/a-vs-an-when-to-use/)

We were all taught that *a* precedes a word starting with a consonant and that
*an* precedes a word starting with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, and sometimes y). But
what matters is the sound of the letter beginning the word, not just the letter
itself. The way we say the word will determine whether or not we use *a* or
*an*.

If the word begins with a vowel sound, you must use *an*. If it begins with
a consonant sound, you must use *a*.
