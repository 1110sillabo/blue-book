Bad grammar can thwart communication. It's especially important in today's world
where we don't have the chance to have in person interactions or when your words
might reach a wide audience. The quality of your text will impact how your
message reaches people.

This article is an effort to gather all my common pitfalls.

# Where to add your pronouns

The correct place to add your pronouns is after you present yourself, such as:

> Hi, I’m Lyz (he/him), I'm writing to tell you…

# [When to capitalize after a question mark](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/25152/does-the-word-after-a-question-mark-start-with-a-capital-letter)

!!! note "TL;DR"

    If the sentence ends after the question mark you should capitalize, if it
    doesn't end, you shouldn't have used the question mark, since it ends
    a sentence.

The capitalization rule that we care about here is that the first word of
a sentence starts with a capital letter, so the question is really about what
ends a sentence. The answer to that is easy: terminal punctuation, i.e. a full
stop, question mark or exclamation mark. There's a visual clue in that `?` and
`!` are decorated full stops; you just have to remember that a colon (`:`) isn't
really a decorated full stop, not that you'd ever know by looking at it. Colons,
semicolons and commas aren't terminal punctuation, so they don't end a sentence
and so don't force the next letter to be a capital. It may be a capital letter
for some other reason such as being the start of a proper name, but not because
it is starting a sentence.

There are exceptions to this rule, occasions when `?` and `!` become
non terminal punctuation. The most obvious is in quoted speech: if the speaker
asks a question or makes an exclamation, the `?` or `!` doesn't have to be
terminal if the sentence carries on after the quote.

> "Should I write it like this?" he asked. "Or perhaps like this?"

The other class of exception is for what are probably really parenthetical
comments. If you have a short phrase that you could have put aside in
parentheses or dashes, then a question mark or exclamation mark can be used at
the end of that phrase without ending the sentence. Be sparing with this. It
looks wrong at a first read.

> Should I write it like this, or abracadabra! like this?

When joining many questions you might may have the doubt of which of the
following is correct:

> Should I write it like this? Or perhaps like this?
> Should I write it like this? or perhaps like this?
> Should I write it like this, or perhaps like that?
> "Should I write it like this?" he asked, "or perhaps like that?"

The second with the lowercase `or` is just plain wrong.

Crusty old grammarians who disapprove of starting sentences with conjunctions
may frown at example 1 all they like, but it's a perfectly acceptable
fragmentary sentence. Whether it's the right answer or not is another question
entirely. Example 1 makes the point that the questions are distinct, though they
are strongly linked otherwise the whole structure wouldn't work.

Example 3 on the other hand emphasizes that the two questions are options in
a common situation, as well as reflecting a different way of saying them. That
is clear in this case because the two questions are tightly coupled
alternatives. However, consider the following:

> Are the lights green? Or is the switch up?
> Are the lights green, or is the switch up?

Both of these examples imply that the state of the lights and the state of the
switch are related somehow. Version 2 couples them more tightly; I would usually
assume (without more context) that either this is the same question being asked
in two different ways (i.e. that the switch being up should cause the lights to
be green), or that they are an exhaustive list of possibilities (either the
switch is up or the lights are green, but not both or neither). This isn't an
absolute rule, but it's quite strongly implied.

Example 4 is also wrong, though it has a better disguise. If you unwrap the
quotes, what you get is:

> Should I write it like this? or perhaps like this?

Which is example 2 back again. What you actually want is one of:

> "Should I write it like this?" he asked. "Or perhaps like this?" (i.e. example 1)
> "Should I write it like this," he asked, "or perhaps like that? (i.e. example 3)

Exclamation marks work like question marks for this purpose. Semicolons don't;
they end a clause, not a sentence.

# [When to write Apostrophes before an s](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/apostrophe/)

* For most singular nouns, add `apostrophe + s`: *The writer's desk*.
* For most plural nouns, add `apostrophe`: *The writers' desk* (multiple writers).
* For plural nouns that do not end in s, add `apostrophe + s`: *The geese's
    migration route*.
* For singular proper nouns both `apostrophe` and `apostrophe + s` is accepted,
    but as the plural proper nouns ending in s, the correct form is `apostrophe`
    I'd use that for both, so: *Charles Dickens' novels* and *The
    Smiths' vacation*.

The personal pronouns, do *not* have apostrophes to form possessives, such as
your, yours, hers, its, ours, their, whose, and theirs. In
fact, for some of these pronouns, adding an apostrophe forms a contraction
instead of a possessive.

# Who vs Whom

If you can replace the word with *she* or *he*, use *who*. If you can replace it
with *her* or *him*, use *whom*.

* *Who*: Should be used to refer to the subject of a sentence.
* *Whom*: Should be used to refer to the object of a verb or preposition.

# [A vs An](https://www.grammar.com/a-vs-an-when-to-use/)

We were all taught that *a* precedes a word starting with a consonant and that
*an* precedes a word starting with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, and sometimes y). But
what matters is the sound of the letter beginning the word, not just the letter
itself. The way we say the word will determine whether or not we use *a* or
*an*.

If the word begins with a vowel sound, you must use *an*. If it begins with
a consonant sound, you must use *a*.

# [Comma before and](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/comma-before-and/)

There are two cases:

* It's required to put a comma before and when it’s connecting two independent clauses.
* It’s [almost always
    optional](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/what-is-the-oxford-comma-and-why-do-people-care-so-much-about-it/)
    the use of comma before and in lists. This case is also known as *serial
    commas* or *Oxford commas*.

Since in some cases is useful, I'm going to use them to reduce the mental load.
