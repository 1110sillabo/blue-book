[Time management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management) is the process
of planning and exercising conscious control of time spent on specific
activities, especially to increase effectiveness, efficiency, and productivity.
It involves a juggling act of various demands upon a person relating to work,
social life, family, hobbies, personal interests, and commitments with the
finiteness of time. Using time effectively gives the person "choice" on spending
or managing activities at their own time and expediency.

To be able to do time management, you first need to define how do you want to
increase your effectiveness, efficiency, and productivity. For me, it means
increasing the amount and quality of work per unit of time or effort.
Understanding work as any task that gets me closer to a goal. It doesn't
necessarily be related with professional work, it can be applied to a personal
project, cleaning or hanging out with friends.

The rest of the article describes the approaches I use to maximize this idea of
efficiency. If you have a different understanding, goal or your brain works in
a different way than mine, most of the guidelines may not apply to you, but they
could spark some ideas that you can implement on your daily life.

To increase the productivity we can:

* [Reduce the time spent doing unproductive tasks](#reduce-the-time-spent-doing-unproductive-tasks).
* [Improve the way we do the tasks so that we can do them in less time](#improve-the-way-we-do-the-tasks-so-that-we-can-do-it-in-less-time).
* [Improve your state and environment to be more efficient](#improve-your-state-and-environment-to-be-more-efficient).

## Reduce the time spent doing unproductive tasks

Sadly, the day has *only* 24 hours you can use. There's nothing to do about it,
we can however reduce the amount of wasted time to make a better use of the time
that we have.

### Minimize the context switches

Each time we switch from one task to another, the brain needs to load all the
necessary information to be able to address the new task. Dumping the old task
information and loading the new is both time consuming and exhausting, so do it
consciously and sparingly.

One way of improving in this front is by using the [Pomodoro
technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) by following the
next steps:

* Decide on the task to be done.
* Set a 20-25 minutes timer.
* Work on the task uninterruptedly.
* End work when the timer rings and put a checkmark on a piece of paper.
* If you have fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break (3–5 minutes) and
    then set the timer again; otherwise continue to the next step.
* After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15–30 minutes), reset your
    checkmark count to zero, then go to step 1.

The difficult part of the workflow is to manage to shut yourself off the world
for that amount of time. One way to do it is by [managing the
interruptions](#interruptions-management).

### Interruption management

We've come to accept that we need to be available 24/7 and answer immediately,
that makes us slaves of the interruptions, it drives our work and personal
relations. I feel that out of respect of ourselves and the other's time, we need
to change that perspective. Most of the times interruptions can wait 20 or 60
minutes, and many of them can be avoided with better task and time planning.

Interruptions are one of the main productivity killers. Not only they
unexpectedly break your workflow, they also add undesired mental load as you are
waiting for them to happen, and need to check them often. As we've seen
previously, to be productive you need to be [able to work on a task for 20
minutes](time_management.md#minimize-the-context-switches) without checking the
interruption channels.
