[Virtual assistant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant) is
a software agent that can perform tasks or services for an individual based on
commands or questions.

Of the open source solutions [kalliope](https://kalliope-project.github.io/) is
the one I've liked most.

To interact with it I may start with the [android
app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=kalliope.project), but then
I'll probably install a Raspberry pi zero with [Pirate
Audio](https://shop.pimoroni.com/collections/pirate-audio) and an [akaso
external mic](https://www.akasotech.com/externalmic) in the kitchen to speed up
the [grocy](grocy.md) inventory management.
