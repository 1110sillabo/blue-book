[Fitness tracker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activity_tracker) or activity
trackers are devices or applications for monitoring and tracking fitness-related
metrics such as distance walked or run, calorie consumption, and in some cases
heartbeat. It is a type of wearable computer.

As with anything that can be bought, I usually first try a cheap model to see if
I need the advanced features that the expensive ones offer. After a quick model
review, I went for the [Amazfit band 5](amazfit_band_5.md).
