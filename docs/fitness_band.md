[Fitness tracker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activity_tracker) or activity
trackers are devices or applications for monitoring and tracking fitness-related
metrics such as distance walked or run, calorie consumption, and in some cases
heartbeat. It is a type of wearable computer.

As with anything that can be bought, I usually first try a cheap model to see if
I need the advanced features that the expensive ones offer. After a quick model
review, I went for the [Amazfit band 5](https://www.amazfit.com/en/band5.html)
because:

* It's supported by [gadgetbridge](gadgetbridge.md).
* It has a SpO2 sensor which enhances the quality of the sleep metrics
* It has sleep metrics, not only time but also type of sleep (light, deep, REM).
* It has support with Alexa, not that I'd use that, but it would be cool if once
    I've got my personal [voice assistant](virtual_assistant.md), I can use it
    through the band.
