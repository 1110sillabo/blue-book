It's really difficult to choose where to start if you want to learn how to draw
from scratch as there are too many resources. I'm starting with
[Drawabox](https://drawabox.com), a free course based on series of practical
exercises to teach the basics. I'd probably go to
[Ctrl+Paint](https://www.ctrlpaint.com/) once I'm done.

# The basics

## [Changing the mindset](https://drawabox.com/lesson/0/2/ready)

Start your drawing path with the following guidelines to make your progression smoother:

* Focus on the experience of drawing instead of the result.
* Understand that doing something badly does not define who you are. So tackle
    the *I can't draw that* feeling with *I can't draw that well*. If
    you're afraid the thing you want to draw is out of your reach, draw it
    anyway.
* [At least half of the time](https://drawabox.com/lesson/0/2/50percent) spent
    drawing must be devoted to drawing purely for its own sake. If you don't
    have much time, alternate the purpose of your sessions.

When doing the course exercises, try to:

* Read only the instruction pages that are assigned to each exercise.
* Don't redo the exercises until you achieve perfection, even when you don't
    feel satisfied with your results. Accept this now, and it will save you
    a lot of grief and wasted time in the future.
* Your only focus should be on following the instructions to the best of your
    current ability. Read and follow the instructions carefully to ensure you
    understand them.
* Each time you finish an exercise incorporate into a pool from which take two
    or three at the beginning of each session to do for 10 or 15 minutes.

## [Tools to use](https://drawabox.com/lesson/0/5)

For the Drawabox course, you need a *fineliner*, also called *felt tips* or
*technical pens*. The author recommends Staedtler Pigments Liners and Faber
Castell PITT Artist Pens (their sizing is different, F is the equivalent to
0.5).

When using it, make sure you're not applying too much pressure, as it will
damage the tip and reduce the flow of ink.

For the paper, use the regular printer one.

## Drawing skills

The course focuses on [these psychological skills and
concepts](https://drawabox.com/lesson/0/3):

* *Confidence*: The willingness to push forwards without hesitation once your
    preparations are complete.
* *Control*: The ability to decide ahead of time what kind of mark you wish to
    puto down on the page, and to execute as intended.
* *Patience*: The path is hard.
* *Spatial Reasoning*: To be able to understand the things we draw as being
    three dimensional forms that exist in and relate to one another within
    the three dimensional world.
* *Construction*: The ability to look at a complex object and break it down into
    simple components that can be drawn individually and combined to reconstruct
    our complex object on a page.
* *Visual Communication*: The ability to take a concept, idea, or amount of
    information, and to convey it clearly and directly to an audience using
    visual means.

Those are applied into [mechanical ](https://drawabox.com/lesson/1/1/mechanical)
and [analytical ](https://drawabox.com/lesson/1/1/analytical) skills.
