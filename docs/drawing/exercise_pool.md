Set of exercises to maintain the fundamental skills required for drawing. Before
doing a drawing session, spend 10-20 minutes doing one or several of these
exercises.

* [Superimposed lines](https://drawabox.com/lesson/1/superimposedlines): for
    different increasing lengths (4cm, 8cm, half the width and full width), draw
    a line with a ruler and repeat the stroke freehand eight times. Also try
    some arcing lines, and even some waves. Make sure you fray only at the end.
