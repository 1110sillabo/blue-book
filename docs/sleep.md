[Sleep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep) is a naturally recurring state of
mind and body, characterized by altered consciousness, relatively inhibited
sensory activity, reduced muscle activity and inhibition of nearly all voluntary
muscles during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep,and reduced interactions with
surroundings. Distinguished from wakefulness by a decreased ability to
react to stimuli.

# Consequences of lack of sleep

Sleeping less than six or seven hours a night can produce these consequences:

*   Demolishing of the immune system.
*   Doubling your risk of cancer.
*   Is a key lifestyle factor determining the development of the Alzheimer's
    disease.
*   Disruption of blood sugar levels so profoundly that you would be classified as
    pre-diabetic.
*   Increase the likelihood of block and brittle of your coronary arteries.
    Setting you on a path toward cardiovascular disease, stroke, and congestive
    heart failure.
*   Contributes to all major psychiatric conditions, including depression,
    anxiety, and suicidality.
*   Swelling concentrations of a hormone that makes you feel hungry while
    suppressing a companion hormone that otherwise signals food satisfaction.

A balanced diet and exercise are of vital importance, but we now see sleep as
the key factor in health. The physical and mental impairments caused by one
night of bad sleep dwarf those caused by an equivalent absence of food or
exercise.

Therefore, **the shorter you sleep, the shorter your life span**.

# Sleep benefits

We sleep for a lot of nighttime benefits that service both our brains and our
body. There does not seem to be one major organ within the body, or process
within the brain, that isn't optimally enhanced by sleep.

Within the brain, sleep enriches our ability to learn, memorize and make logical
decisions and choices. It recalibrates our emotional brain circuits, allowing us
to navigate next day social and psychological challenges with cool-headed
composture.

Downstairs in the body, sleep:

*   Restocks the armory of our immune system: helping fight malignancy, preventing
    infection, and warding off sickness.
*   Reforms the body's metabolic state by fine-tuning the balance of insulin and
    circulating glucose.
*   Regulates our appetite, helping control body weight through healthy food
    selection rather than rash impulsivity.
*   Maintains a flourishing microbiome within your gut essential to our
    nutritional health being.
*   Is tied to the fitness of our cardiovascular system, lowering blood pressure
    while keeping our hearts in fine condition.

Dreaming produces a neurochemical bath that mollifies painful memories and
a virtual reality space in which the brain melds past and present knowledge,
inspiring creativity.

Therefore, **Sleep is the single most effective thing we can do to reset our
brain and body health each day**.

# Sleep physiological effects

There are two main factors that determine when you want to sleep or stay awake:

*   The signal sent by the suprachiasmatic nucleus following the circadian rhythm.
*   Sleep pressure: The brain builds up a chemical substance that creates
    the "sleep pressure". The longer you've been awake, the more that chemical
    sleep pressure accumulates, and consequentially, the sleepier you feel.

## The circadian rhythm

We have an internal clock deep within the brain, called the suprachiasmatic
nucleus, that creates a cycling, day-night rhythm, known as circadian rhythm,
that makes you feel tired or alert at regular times of night and day,
respectively. The circadian rhythm determines:

* When you want to be awake or asleep.
* Your timed preferences for eating and drinking.
* Your moods and emotions
* The amount of urine you produce.
* Your core body temperature.
* Your metabolic rate.
* The release of numerous hormones.

Contrary to common belief, circadian rhythm is not defined by the daylight sun
cycle. As Kleitman and Richardson demonstrated in 1938:

*   When cut off from the daily cycle of light and dark, the body keeps on
    maintaining the rhythm.
*   The period of the circadian rhythm is different for each person, but has an
    average of 24 hours and 15 minutes.

Even if it's not defined by the sun light, it corrects those 15 minutes of delay
to stay in sync with it. The suprachiasmatic nucleus can readjust by about one
hour each day, that is why jet lag can be spawn through multiple days.

That reset does not come free. Studies in airplane cabin crews who frequently
fly on long haul routes and have little chance to recover have registered:

*   The part of the brains related to learning and memory had physically shrunk,
    suggesting the destruction of brain cells caused by the biological stress of
    timezone travel.
*   Their short term memory was significantly impaired.
*   They had far higher rates of cancer and type 2 diabetes than the general
    population.

The peak and valley points of wakefulness or sleepiness vary too between people,
it's known as their [*chronotype*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronotype) and
it's strongly determined by genetics. The chronotype defines three types of
people:

*   *Morning types*: They have their peak of wakefulness early in the day and the
    sleepiness early at night. They prefer to wake at or around dawn, and
    function optimally at this time of day.
*   *Evening types*: They prefer going to bed late and subsequently wake up late
    the following morning, or even in the afternoon.
*   *In between*: The remaining people fall somewhere in between, with a slight
    leaning towards eveningness.

### Melatonin

The suprachiasmatic nucleus communicates its repeating signal of day and night
to your brain and body by releasing
[melatonin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin) into the bloodstream from
the pineal gland. Soon after dusk, the suprachiasmatic nucleus starts increasing
the levels of this hormone, telling the rest of the body that it's time to
sleep. But melatonin has little influence on the generation of sleep itself.

Once sleep is under way, melatonin decreases in concentration across the night
and into the morning hours. With dawn, as sunlight enters the brain through the
eyes (even through the closed lids), the pineal gland is instructed to stop
releasing melatonin. The absence of circulating melatonin now informs the brain
and body that it's time to return to a wakefulness active state for the rest of
the day

## Sleep pressure

While you are awake, the brain is releasing a chemical called adenosine. One
consequence of the increasing accumulation of adenosine is the increase of the
desire to sleep by turning down the "volume" of wake promoting regions in the
brain and turning up the sleep inducing ones. Most people fall to the pressure
after twelve to sixteen hours of being awake.

### Caffeine

You can artificially mute the sleep signal of adenosine by using a chemical that
makes you feel more alert and awake, such as caffeine. Caffeine works by
battling with adenosine for the privilege of latching on to adenosine receptors
in the brain. Once caffeine occupies these receptors, it does not stimulate them
like adenosine, making you sleepy. Rather, caffeine blocks and effectively
inactivates the receptors acting as a masking agent.

Levels of caffeine peak around thirty minutes after ingestion. What is
problematic, though, is the persistence of caffeine in your system. It takes
between five to seven hours to remove 50 percent of the caffeine concentration
from your body.

An enzyme within your liver removes caffeine from your system. Based in large
part on genetics, some people have a more efficient version of the enzyme that
degrades caffeine, allowing the liver to clear it from the bloodstream.
Age is also a variable to take into account, the older we are the longer it
takes our brain and body to remove it.

When your liver evicts the caffeine from your system, you encounter the
*caffeine crash*. Your energy levels plummet rapidly, finding difficult to
function and concentrate, with a strong sense of sleepiness once again.

For the entire time that caffeine is in your system, the adenosine keeps on
building up. Your brain is not aware of this rising tide of sleep encouraging
chemical because the wall of caffeine is holding it back from your perception.
Once your liver dismantles the barricade, you feel a vicious backlash: you
are hit with the sleepiness you had experienced two or three hours ago before
you drank that cup of coffee plus all the extra adenosine that has accumulated
in the hours in between.

## Relationship between the circadian rhythm and the sleep pressure

The two governing forces that regulate your sleep are ignorant of each other.
Although they are not coupled, they are usually aligned.

Starting on the far left of the figure, the circadian rhythm begins to increase
its activity a few hours before you wake up. It infuses the brain and body with
an alerting energy signal. At first, the signal is faint, but gradually it
builds with time. By early afternoon, the activating signal from the circadian
rhythm peaks.

Now let's look at the sleep pressure pattern. By mid to late morning, you have
only been awake for a half of hours. As a result, adenosine concentrations
have increased a little. Furthermore, the circadian rhythm is on its
powerful upswing of alertness. This combination of strong activating output
from the circadian rhythm together with low levels of adenosine result in
a delightful sensation of being wide awake.

The distance between the curved lines above will be a direct reflection of your
desire to sleep.

By eleven pm, you've been awake for fifteen hours, and your brain is drenched in
high concentrations of adenosine. Additionally, the circadian rhythm line is
descending, powering down your activity and alertness levels. This powerful
combination triggers a strong desire for sleep.

During sleep, a mass evacuation of adenosine gets under way as the brain has the
chance to degrade and remove it. After eight hours of healthy sleep, the
adenosine purge is complete. As this process is ending, the circadian
activity rhythm has returned, and its energizing influence starts to approach,
therefore naturally waking us up.
