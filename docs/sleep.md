[Sleep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep) is a naturally recurring state of
mind and body, characterized by altered consciousness, relatively inhibited
sensory activity, reduced muscle activity and inhibition of nearly all voluntary
muscles during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep,and reduced interactions with
surroundings. Distinguished from wakefulness by a decreased ability to
react to stimuli.

# Consequences of lack of sleep

Sleeping less than six or seven hours a night can produce these consequences:

*   Demolishing of the immune system.
*   Doubling your risk of cancer.
*   Is a key lifestyle factor determining the development of the Alzheimer's
    disease.
*   Disruption of blood sugar levels so profoundly that you would be classified as
    pre-diabetic.
*   Increase the likelihood of block and brittle of your coronary arteries.
    Setting you on a path toward cardiovascular disease, stroke, and congestive
    heart failure.
*   Contributes to all major psychiatric conditions, including depression,
    anxiety, and suicidality.
*   Swelling concentrations of a hormone that makes you feel hungry while
    suppressing a companion hormone that otherwise signals food satisfaction.

A balanced diet and exercise are of vital importance, but we now see sleep as
the key factor in health. The physical and mental impairments caused by one
night of bad sleep dwarf those caused by an equivalent absence of food or
exercise.

Therefore, **the shorter you sleep, the shorter your life span**.

# Sleep benefis

We sleep for a lot of nighttime benefits that service both our brains and our
body. There does not seem to be one major organ within the body, or process
within the brain, that isn't optimally enhanced by sleep.

Within the brain, sleep enriches our ability to learn, memorize and make logical
decisions and choices. It recalibrates our emotional brain circuits, allowing us
to navigate next day social and psychological challenges with cool-headed
composture.

Downstairs in the body, sleep:

*   Restocks the armory of our immune system: helping fight malignancy, preventing
    infection, and warding off sickness.
*   Reforms the body's metabolic state by fine-tuning the balance of insulin and
    circulating glucose.
*   Regulates our appetite, helping control body weight through healthy food
    selection rather than rash impulsivity.
*   Maintains a flourishing microbiome within your gut essential to our
    nutritional health being.
*   Is tied to the fitness of our cardiovascular system, lowering blood pressure
    while keeping our hearts in fine condition.

Dreaming produces a neurochemical bath that mollifies painful memories and
a virtual reality space in which the brain melds past and present knowledge,
inspiring creativity.

Therefore, **Sleep is the single most effective thing we can do to reset our
brain and body health each day**.

# Sleep physiological effects

There are two main factors that determine when you want to sleep or stay awake:

*   The signal sent by the suprachiasmatic nucleus following the circadian rhythm.
*   Sleep pressure: The brain builds up a chemical substance that creates
    the "sleep pressure". The longer you've been awake, the more that chemical
    sleep pressure accumulates, and consequentially, the sleepier you feel.

## The circadian rhythm

We have an internal clock deep within the brain, called the suprachiasmatic
nucleus, that creates a cycling, day-night rhythm, known as circadian rhythm,
that makes you feel tired or alert at regular times of night and day,
respectively. The circadian rhythm determines:

* When you want to be awake or asleep.
* Your timed preferences for eating and drinking.
* Your moods and emotions
* The amount of urine you produce.
* Your core body temperature.
* Your metabolic rate.
* The release of numerous hormones.

Contrary to common belief, circadian rhythm is not defined by the daylight sun
cycle. As Kleitman and Richardson demonstrated in 1938:

*   When cut off from the daily cycle of light and dark, the body keeps on
    maintaining the rhythm.
*   The period of the circadian rhythm is different for each person, but has an
    average of 24 hours and 15 minutes.

Even if it's not defined by the sun light, it corrects those 15 minutes of delay
to stay in sync with it. The suprachiasmatic nucleus can readjust by about one
hour each day, that is why jetlag can be spawn through multiple days.

That reset does not come free. Studies in airplane cabin crews who frequently
fly on long-haul routes and have little chance to recover have registered:

*   The part of the brains related to learning and memory had physically shrunk,
    suggesting the destruction of brain cells caused by the biological stress of
    time-zone travel.
*   Their short-term memory was significantly impaired.
*   They had far higher rates of cancer and type 2 diabetes than the general
    population.

The peak and valley points of wakefulness or sleepiness vary too between people,
it's known as their [*chronotype*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronotype) and
it's strongly determined by genetics. The chronotype defines three types of
people:

*   *Morning types*: They have their peak of wakefulness early in the day and the
    sleepiness early at night. They prefer to wake at or around dawn, and
    function optimally at this time of day.
*   *Evening types*: They prefer going to bed late and subsequently wake up late
    the following morning, or even in the afternoon.
*   *In between*: The remaining people fall somewhere in between, with a slight
    leaning towards eveningness.

### Melatonin

The suprachiasmatic nucleus communicates its repeating signal of day and night
to your brain and body by releasing
[melatonin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin) into the bloodstream from
the pineal gland. Soon after dusk, the suprachiasmatic nucleus starts increasing
the levels of this hormone, telling the rest of the body that it's time to
sleep. But melatonin has little influence on the generation of sleep itself.

Once sleep is under way, melatonin decreases in concentration across the night
and into the morning hours. With dawn, as sunlight enters the brain through the
eyes (even through the closed lids), the pineal gland is instructed to stop
releasing melatonin. The absence of circulating melatonin now informs the brain
and body that it's time to return to a wakefulness active state for the rest of
the day
