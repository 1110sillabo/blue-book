[asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) is a library to write
concurrent code using the async/await syntax.

asyncio is used as a foundation for multiple Python asynchronous frameworks that
provide high-performance network and web-servers, database connection libraries,
distributed task queues, etc.

asyncio is often a perfect fit for IO-bound and high-level structured network
code.
