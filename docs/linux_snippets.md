# [Identify what a string or file contains](https://github.com/bee-san/pyWhat)

Identify anything. `pyWhat` easily lets you identify emails, IP addresses, and
more. Feed it a .pcap file or some text and it'll tell you what it is.

# [Split a file into many with equal number of lines](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2016894/how-to-split-a-large-text-file-into-smaller-files-with-equal-number-of-lines)

You could do something like this:

```bash
split -l 200000 filename
```

Which will create files each with 200000 lines named `xaa`, `xab`, `xac`, ...

# Check if an rsync command has gone well

Sometimes after you do an `rsync` between two directories of different devices
(an usb and your hard drive for example), the sizes of the directories don't
match. I've seen a difference of a 30% less on the destination. `du`, `ncdu` and
`and` have a long story of reporting wrong sizes with advanced filesystems (ZFS,
VxFS or compressing filesystems), these do a lot of things to reduce the disk
usage (deduplication, compression, extents, files with holes...) which may lead
to the difference in space.

To check if everything went alright run `diff -r --brief source/ dest/`, and
check that there is no output.

# [List all process swap usage](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-which-process-is-using-swap/)

```bash
for file in /proc/*/status ; do awk '/VmSwap|Name/{printf $2 " " $3}END{ print ""}' $file; done | sort -k 2 -n -r | less
```
